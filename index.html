        <h1>Cell Differences</h1>
        <p>This web-page has difference between plant cells and animal cells.

            <h2>Plant cell</h2>
            
            <li > In addition to cell membrane,Plant cells 
                also have a cell wall which is the most
                outer covering layer of the cell which is rigid.
            </li>
            <li > There is large vacuole present in it.
                About 80 to 90 % place is occupied by it. 
            </li>
            <li >
                Due to the vacuole present in it,the nucleus is 
                pushed to one side in cell.
            </li>
            <li  > 
                Plastid-chloroplasts containing chlorophyll is
                present in it.
            </li>
            <li >
                They do not chage the shape as they are rigid.
            </li>
            <li >
                Lysosomes are absent in plant cells.
            </li>
            <li  >
                Plant cells do not burst while kept in hypotonic
                solution due to the rigidity of cell wall.
            </li>

            <li >
                In this,Vacuoles are generally small.

            <li >
                In,this nucleus is almost in the middle of the cell.

            <li >
                There is lack of chloroplasts in it.

            <li >
                They can change there shape

                Lysosomes are present in it.

                Animal cells may burst while kept in hypotonic solution.
